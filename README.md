# graph-plane-extraction-simulation

This repository serves as a counterpart of the ISPRS Annals paper ``Graph-theoretical approach to robust 3D normal extraction of LiDAR data"

The main file is the simulation_repeated_runs.py which runs 30 repeated runs using different kinds of weights and plots the accuracy and loss over the runs.
